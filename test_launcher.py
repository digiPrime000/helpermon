"""
Learning the game's icon, finding it again, and waiting out a cold boot.

Synthetic screens throughout: the point is the mechanism -- learn a crop, find
it at another window size, refuse when it is absent, and tell a booting
emulator from a finished one -- and none of that needs the real thing.

Uses a throwaway data folder, never the real userdata.
