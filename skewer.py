Skewer bot. Cooking minigame: read the order, build the same skewer, submit.

A third bot, same family as dungeon.py rather than the board minigame: no
scrolling world, no pathfinding, just "recognise the screen, do exactly one
action, verify, repeat" against a fixed layout. See dungeon.py's own module
docstring for the same idea applied to the dungeon list.

Loop, once an order is showing
  1. Read the order strip and confirm it is the SAME on two consecutive
     frames, so a half-drawn order is never acted on.
  2. Click that order's ingredients in turn on the 4x3 grid, counting the
     clicks rather than re-reading the plate.
  3. Abandon and start over if the order changes underneath.
  4. Once as many clicks went out as the order is long, click Complete and
     wait for a different order to appear.

Repeat until the round timer runs out or the "Failed..." dialog / the
gameplay screen itself disappears.

Ingredient icons are not shipped with the program, same policy as the rest
of this project. Learn them from your own screen first:

  py learn_skewer.py              learn the 12 grid icons once
  py skewer.py --probe            shows what is recognised, clicks nothing
                                   (saves to debug_skewer/<timestamp>/,
                                    add --tag NAME to label the run)
  py skewer.py                    dry run, plans but does NOT click
  py skewer.py --go               actually clicks
  py skewer.py --go --rounds 3
  py skewer.py --go --speed 1.1   same, but 10% less waiting between
                                   clicks -- the dial to chase a score
                                   with, raise it gradually
  py skewer.py --go --no-complete debug: build one order, hold before
                                   Complete, then --probe it in another
                                   terminal

Two different recognition strategies are in use, deliberately.

The 4x3 grid is fixed and unscaled, so it is matched at fixed positions by
straight template correlation -- see GRID_COLS_FX/GRID_ROWS_FY. This part
is solid, matches come back 0.9-1.0 against real templates.

The order strip and the plate have neither fixed icon count, nor fixed
spacing, nor even fixed positions -- a short order leaves its ingredients
spread apart along the stick, a long one packs them until they overlap --
so nothing positional works there. They are read in two stages instead:
find the ingredients geometrically, then name each by argmax over all
twelve -- see find_strip_icons and the SKEWER_* comment above it. No match
threshold is involved anywhere in that path, which is the point: the two
earlier threshold-based versions each dropped real ingredients that scored
a hundredth under the cutoff.

# Third architecture for this, and the first one that is not built on an
# absolute match threshold. The two earlier ones slid ingredient templates
# across the strip and kept every peak above STRIP_ICON_THRESHOLD (0.80).
# Both failed the same way: measured against a real 5-icon order, the five
# correct icons scored 0.87 / 0.80 / 0.93 / 0.80 / 0.86 -- two of them sat
# exactly ON the cutoff. An icon that dips a hundredth under is silently
# dropped rather than reported, which is precisely the "an ingredient got
# skipped" bug seen live. Lowering the cutoff was not a fix either: at a
# neighbouring window size a phantom `tuna` scored 0.82, i.e. above it.
# Threshold-based reading trades dropped icons against invented ones, and
# there is no setting where it does neither.
#
# So: find the icons GEOMETRICALLY first, then name each one by argmax over
# all twelve candidates. argmax cannot drop an icon (something is always the
# best match) and cannot invent one (positions come from pixels, not scores).
# Absolute scores stop mattering; only the ranking does.
#
# Step 1, the run. Inside the white speech bubble (order) or white plate
# (current), a column carrying an icon has visibly more non-background pixel
# height than a column carrying only the bare wooden stick. Measured on a
# real 5-icon capture: bare stick 17-23 px, icon columns 24-55 px, no
# overlap. Deliberately NOT the black outline between icons, which was tried
# first and does not work -- pale ingredients (onion, shrimp) have such thin
# outlines that they read the same as the stick, and dark ones (dark_meat)
# are dark right through their middle so the seams vanish.
# The container the skewer lies on. Measured on a real frame: bubble and
# plate are near-grey (saturation 0-3), while even the palest ingredient
# measured 88, so saturation separates them cleanly where brightness does
# not (that ingredient is brighter than the plate it sits on).

#

# bubble is pure white (255 throughout), while the plate only reaches 236 and
# sits around 223 -- one fixed cutoff cannot serve both, and a bubble-tuned
# 245 made every plate pixel count as content, which read as "no icons here".

# recover N geometrically was fragile (equal-slot scoring picks the wrong N;
# silhouette-valley detection over-splits; autocorrelation puts the period
# at 37 px where the true spacing is 34). Instead a narrow window is slid
# across the run and classified at every step, and consecutive identical
# readings are grouped. Each group is one icon, and a group about twice the
# median width is two of the same ingredient in a row. On the real 5-icon
# capture the groups came out clean and well separated (7/6/8/6/9 samples,
# spans 24/20/28/20/32 px) and collapsed to exactly the right order.

#
# Icon pitch along the skewer, as a fraction of the strip crop's width.
# Measured across seven real captures once the wooden stick is subtracted
# from the run: run width came out 181-188 px in a 650 px crop for five
# ingredients, i.e. a pitch of 36-38 px, and dividing by 37 recovers "5" on
# every one of them (5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.1, 4.9, 5.0, 4.9).
#
# ASSUMPTION, and the weakest thing in this file: all seven of those
# captures are FIVE-ingredient orders, so whether the pitch stays put for
# other lengths is untested. The two possibilities are not distinguishable
# from the data at hand -- either the game keeps icons the same size and
# lengthens the skewer (pitch fixed, this is right), or it keeps the skewer
# the same length and shrinks the icons (pitch shrinks, and this reads a
# long order as a five). A note from an earlier session, comparing a 3-icon
# against a 4-icon order, leans toward the second. Verify with a --probe of
# a clearly shorter and a clearly longer order before trusting this.
#
# Counting by classification instead was tried and is worse: it needs each
# ingredient to form its own run of identical readings, and measured over
# the same seven captures it got the count right on only four -- an
# ingredient that reads like its neighbour merges away, and one that reads
# unstably splits in two.

# 4x3 ingredient grid, bottom third. Best-guess names from the screenshot,
# meant to be corrected in learn_skewer.py or the wizard's Skewer step --
# pink_item/brown_item in particular are placeholders, not real names.
#
# KNOWN, measured over 13 real captures: these rows are about 9 thousandths
# too low. The icon sits hard against the TOP edge of its crop (median top
# margin 0.0 px) with ~22 px of dead space below it, so tall icons are
# clipped and every template carries ~6% less of its ingredient than it
# could. Shifting GRID_ROWS_FY by -0.009, to (0.664, 0.771, 0.878), balances
# the margins to 1.0/11.5 px.
#
# Deliberately NOT applied. The fractions are baked into every learned
# template, so changing them means relearning all twelve icons and redoing
# the strip verification -- against a setup that currently measures 0.92-0.99
# in the grid and 42/42 on the strip. Change it when the templates are being
# relearned anyway, not before.
#
# Whether the crop should also be TALLER is untested: measuring that needs an
# oversized crop, and at anything near the row pitch (0.107) the icon blob
# merges with the neighbouring row, so the measurement contradicts itself.

# "strip" set (skewerstrip_*.png) on the theory that an icon on a skewer is

# border and background -- which is a large part of why strip matching
# never scored better than ~0.8 and behaved differently on the plate (a
# different background) than in the order strip.
#
# What replaced it is not a better template but a background-independent
# comparison: a masked hue/saturation histogram (see _colour_signature).
# Pixel correlation is dominated by the background -- a grid template sits
# on a dark button, a skewer icon on a white plate, and TM_CCOEFF_NORMED
# between the two scores near zero even when it is plainly the same
# ingredient. Masking the background away and comparing colour instead
# scored the same five real icons 0.97 / 0.90 / 0.68 / 0.61 / 0.96 against

    Measured against ten real order captures covering 2-, 3- and
    5-ingredient orders, 42 ingredients in total: counts 10/10, names 42/42.

    Both halves of that came from removing a single wrong idea, not from
    tuning. While the wooden stick was being masked out by colour, it took
    58-78% of the pale ingredients with it (they are the same hue); naming
    then failed on every `egg`, and counting failed on three captures
    because the sliding read could not tell one ingredient from the next.
    Leaving the stick in the crop and separating it by height instead fixed
    both at once.

    Still untested against real pixels: an order holding the same
    ingredient twice SIDE BY SIDE. _count_in_cluster counts changes in the
    sliding read, so such a pair reads as one. No capture has shown that
    case (110400 repeats raw_meat, but with tuna between them, and reads
    correctly).

    The PLATE is read by the same code and is less reliable there -- it
    tends to lose the leftmost ingredient, because the plate is an oval and
    near its ends there is much less of it above and below the stick. The

    # settle, a round to start. Those are paced by the game and shortening

        never proof here, exactly as everywhere else in this project.

        I", instead of re-deriving that from a fresh image read of the
        current/plate strip on every step the way an earlier version did.
        That was forced at the time: plate reading was broken outright, and
        a live run showed `current` never once registering a successful
        add, so per-click verification looped on the first ingredient
        forever. Each grid tap is trusted once its cell is matched, the
        same trust already placed in the grid everywhere else in this file.

        Plate reading has since been rebuilt and does now work -- against
        the first real capture of a populated plate it read all five
        ingredients correctly (see the SKEWER_* block). Re-enabling
        click_ingredient/click_undo here, so every tap is verified against
        the plate again, is therefore back on the table, but it is a
        behavioural change that costs a read per click and has not been
        tried live yet; it is left alone deliberately rather than by
